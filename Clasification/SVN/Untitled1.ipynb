    "### Hyperplane \n",
    "##### In geometry, a hyperplane is a subspace that has one dimension fewer than its ambient space.The hyperplane separates the space into two parts. A classifier is linear when it uses a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate data. From geometry, the general equation for a hyperplane is :  $$1)w*x=0$$ or  $$<w|x>=0$$\n",
    "##### For example in 2D space the equation of hyperplane is the line where : <br>   $$ 2) a*x +b = y$$\n",
    "##### Rewriting the equation for the line yields the standard form for the hyperplane, which is:$$ a*x +b -y =0$$\n",

    "##### The vector w must be perpendicular (normal) to the hyperplane H0 because the dot product is zero by definition, when the cosine of the angle between x and w is zero. The cosine is zero when the angle is 90 degrees. For the 2D example $$ u = \\frac{w}{||w||}=\\Big(\\frac{w1}{||w1||},\\frac{w2}{||w2||}\\Big)$$"

For example, vector p in Figure 1 is the projection of point A onto the plane of the w vector. Hence the distance from point A to the hyperplane is the same as the length of p or ||p||. The projection of vector a onto the plane of w is p where $$p = (u*a)u $$ The dot product produces a scalar, which is the magnitude (length) of the vector such that.$$ u*a = \\sum_iu_ia_i $$"
