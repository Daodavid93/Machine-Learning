### Gradient Descent -Explanation 
##### The methods for finding the maximum and minimum (extrema) of function have been created with developing of mathematical
##### analysis.Gradient descent is numerical approach to find extrema of function which is enough optimized and it is very 
##### used especially in machine learning.The algorithm is very simple and very convenient in case when the function has only
##### one extremum,when the function has many local extrema the task become more difficult which can be solved by manipulationg the increase x step or so called 'learning rate'
